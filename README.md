# django-hyakunin-isshu


This project was inspired by the excellent [manga]() and [anime]() Chihayafuru (10/10) about the players of karuta and Ogura Hyakunin Isshu. Karuta is a unique japanese sport of acute reflexes, hand-eye-ear coordination, and memory, centered around the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu antology of poems from the []() centuries. 
<br>
The manga and anime provide translated parts of the poems that are currently read in a karuta match, but I found myself often wanting to read the complete poem in my own time. The available originals and their translations can be found in the forms of [blogs](), as a part of [departmental projects]() at universities, or in a [physical form](). I wanted to make the poems available in a more convenient form with a modern and clean user interface.
<br> 
I also needed an excuse to use python to scrape someone else's website and set up a DRF-React app.
<br>
<br>
Django and Django REST framework (DRF) are used on the backend, React is used on the frontend. You can check out other vital packages in requirements.txt and package.json

#### Comments:
**lab-book.md** files are used throughout this django project as a way to document my work in a protocol form (similar to a science lab book, but a lot less strict on format).
